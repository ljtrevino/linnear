# Linnear

### What is this project?
A site for easily finding and accessing my notes and study guides from my time at MIT and Buffalo Grove High School

### Where can I access the website?
https://lrylander.github.io/linnear/build/

### When will it be updated?
The site currently demonstrates basic functionality necessary to find and inspect notes.  Features that will be implemented soon include:
* New classes (added each semester)
* Search bar that finds documents based keywords found in the documents
* Aesthetic updates and theme toggling
* Help page

### Helpful commands
* `npm start` to develop locally on localhost:8080
